WELCOME TO OPTICAL ESCAPE   

The object of the game is to find the cube in the room that will change green, and look at it long enough to eliminate it. All other cubes
remaining in the room will turn red, and if looked at for too long will lock in place. If too many cubes are locked in place before all of the cubes are
eliminated, the scene will reset!

As the game progresses, incorrect cubes grow impatient and turn red much faster while simultaneously fading back to their starting color slower.

Simply running `python build.py` while inside of the `/game ` directory, then running `./optical_escape ` while in the same directory should get the job done, but it may require some troubleshooting as I haven't tested it out on non-linux platforms.


I built this project for my graduate level graphics class. It's constructed using OpenGL and SDL2 as well as some code from class written by Mike Shah which was altered and expanded upon.

I made the skybox in GIMP from an image I found online and made cube textures by blending images I found online as well.
